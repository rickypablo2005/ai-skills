## bug-hunter

> **Descrição original:** Systematically finds and fixes bugs using proven debugging techniques. Traces from symptoms to root cause, implements fixes, and prevents regression.
>
> **Fonte:** `community`

Systematically hunt down and fix bugs using proven debugging techniques. No guessing—follow the evidence.

### When to Use This Skill

- User reports a bug or error
- Something isn't working as expected
- User says "fix the bug" or "debug this"
- Intermittent failures or weird behavior
- Production issues need investigation

### The Debugging Process

#### 1. Reproduce the Bug

First, make it happen consistently:

```
1. Get exact steps to reproduce
2. Try to reproduce locally
3. Note what triggers it
4. Document the error message/behavior
5. Check if it happens every time or randomly
```

If you can't reproduce it, gather more info:
- What environment? (dev, staging, prod)
- What browser/device?
- What user actions preceded it?
- Any error logs?

#### 2. Gather Evidence

Collect all available information:

**Check logs:**
```bash
# Application logs
tail -f logs/app.log

# System logs
journalctl -u myapp -f

# Browser console
# Open DevTools → Console tab
```

**Check error messages:**
- Full stack trace
- Error type and message
- Line numbers
- Timestamp

**Check state:**
- What data was being processed?
- What was the user trying to do?
- What's in the database?
- What's in local storage/cookies?

#### 3. Form a Hypothesis

Based on evidence, guess what's wrong:

```
"The login times out because the session cookie 
expires before the auth check completes"

"The form fails because email validation regex 
doesn't handle plus signs"

"The API returns 500 because the database query 
has a syntax error with special characters"
```

#### 4. Test the Hypothesis

Prove or disprove your guess:

**Add logging:**
```javascript
console.log('Before API call:', userData);
const response = await api.login(userData);
console.log('After API call:', response);
```

**Use debugger:**
```javascript
debugger; // Execution pauses here
const result = processData(input);
```

**Isolate the problem:**
```javascript
// Comment out code to narrow down
// const result = complexFunction();
const result = { mock: 'data' }; // Use mock data
```

#### 5. Find Root Cause

Trace back to the actual problem:

**Common root causes:**
- Null/undefined values
- Wrong data types
- Race conditions
- Missing error handling
- Incorrect logic
- Off-by-one errors
- Async/await issues
- Missing validation

**Example trace:**
```
Symptom: "Cannot read property 'name' of undefined"
↓
Where: user.profile.name
↓
Why: user.profile is undefined
↓
Why: API didn't return profile
↓
Why: User ID was null
↓
Root cause: Login didn't set user ID in session
```

#### 6. Implement Fix

Fix the root cause, not the symptom:

**Bad fix (symptom):**
```javascript
// Just hide the error
const name = user?.profile?.name || 'Unknown';
```

**Good fix (root cause):**
```javascript
// Ensure user ID is set on login
const login = async (credentials) => {
  const user = await authenticate(credentials);
  if (user) {
    session.userId = user.id; // Fix: Set user ID
    return user;
  }
  throw new Error('Invalid credentials');
};
```

#### 7. Test the Fix

Verify it actually works:

```
1. Reproduce the original bug
2. Apply the fix
3. Try to reproduce again (should fail)
4. Test edge cases
5. Test related functionality
6. Run existing tests
```

#### 8. Prevent Regression

Add a test so it doesn't come back:

```javascript
test('login sets user ID in session', async () => {
  const user = await login({ email: 'test@example.com', password: 'pass' });
  
  expect(session.userId).toBe(user.id);
  expect(session.userId).not.toBeNull();
});
```

### Debugging Techniques

#### Binary Search

Cut the problem space in half repeatedly:

```javascript
// Does the bug happen before or after this line?
console.log('CHECKPOINT 1');
// ... code ...
console.log('CHECKPOINT 2');
// ... code ...
console.log('CHECKPOINT 3');
```

#### Rubber Duck Debugging

Explain the code line by line out loud. Often you'll spot the issue while explaining.

#### Print Debugging

Strategic console.logs:

```javascript
console.log('Input:', input);
console.log('After transform:', transformed);
console.log('Before save:', data);
console.log('Result:', result);
```

#### Diff Debugging

Compare working vs broken:
- What changed recently?
- What's different between environments?
- What's different in the data?

#### Time Travel Debugging

Use git to find when it broke:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad  # Current commit is broken
git bisect good abc123  # This old commit worked
# Git will check out commits for you to test
```

### Common Bug Patterns

#### Null/Undefined

```javascript
// Bug
const name = user.profile.name;

// Fix
const name = user?.profile?.name || 'Unknown';

// Better fix
if (!user || !user.profile) {
  throw new Error('User profile required');
}
const name = user.profile.name;
```

#### Race Condition

```javascript
// Bug
let data = null;
fetchData().then(result => data = result);
console.log(data); // null - not loaded yet

// Fix
const data = await fetchData();
console.log(data); // correct value
```

#### Off-by-One

```javascript
// Bug
for (let i = 0; i <= array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]); // undefined on last iteration
}

// Fix
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
```

#### Type Coercion

```javascript
// Bug
if (count == 0) { // true for "", [], null
  
// Fix
if (count === 0) { // only true for 0
```

#### Async Without Await

```javascript
// Bug
const result = asyncFunction(); // Returns Promise
console.log(result.data); // undefined

// Fix
const result = await asyncFunction();
console.log(result.data); // correct value
```

### Debugging Tools

#### Browser DevTools

```
Console: View logs and errors
Sources: Set breakpoints, step through code
Network: Check API calls and responses
Application: View cookies, storage, cache
Performance: Find slow operations
```

#### Node.js Debugging

```javascript
// Built-in debugger
node --inspect app.js

// Then open chrome://inspect in Chrome
```

#### VS Code Debugging

```json
// .vscode/launch.json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Debug App",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
}
```

### When You're Stuck

1. Take a break (seriously, walk away for 10 minutes)
2. Explain it to someone else (or a rubber duck)
3. Search for the exact error message
4. Check if it's a known issue (GitHub issues, Stack Overflow)
5. Simplify: Create minimal reproduction
6. Start over: Delete and rewrite the problematic code
7. Ask for help (provide context, what you've tried)

### Documentation Template

After fixing, document it:

```markdown
## Bug: Login timeout after 30 seconds

**Symptom:** Users get logged out immediately after login

**Root Cause:** Session cookie expires before auth check completes

**Fix:** Increased session timeout from 30s to 3600s in config

**Files Changed:**
- config/session.js (line 12)

**Testing:** Verified login persists for 1 hour

**Prevention:** Added test for session persistence
```

### Key Principles

- Reproduce first, fix second
- Follow the evidence, don't guess
- Fix root cause, not symptoms
- Test the fix thoroughly
- Add tests to prevent regression
- Document what you learned

### Related Skills

- `@systematic-debugging` - Advanced debugging
- `@test-driven-development` - Testing
- `@codebase-audit-pre-push` - Code review

### Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## diagnosing-bugs

> **Descrição original:** Diagnosis loop for hard bugs and performance regressions. Use when the user says "diagnose"/"debug this", or reports something broken/throwing/failing/slow.
>
> **Fonte:** `mattpocock/skills`  
> **Autor:** Matt Pocock

### When to Use

Use when this workflow matches the user request: Use this skill for its documented workflow.


_Source: [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT)._

A discipline for hard bugs. Skip phases only when explicitly justified.

When exploring the codebase, read `CONTEXT.md` (if it exists) to get a clear mental model of the relevant modules, and check ADRs in the area you're touching.

### Phase 1 — Build a feedback loop

**This is the skill.** Everything else is mechanical. If you have a **tight** pass/fail signal for the bug — one that goes red on _this_ bug — you will find the cause; bisection, hypothesis-testing, and instrumentation all just consume it. If you don't have one, no amount of staring at code will save you.

Spend disproportionate effort here. **Be aggressive. Be creative. Refuse to give up.**

#### Ways to construct one — try them in roughly this order

1. **Failing test** at whatever seam reaches the bug — unit, integration, e2e.
2. **Curl / HTTP script** against a running dev server.
3. **CLI invocation** with a fixture input, diffing stdout against a known-good snapshot.
4. **Headless browser script** (Playwright / Puppeteer) — drives the UI, asserts on DOM/console/network.
5. **Replay a captured trace.** Save a real network request / payload / event log to disk; replay it through the code path in isolation.
6. **Throwaway harness.** Spin up a minimal subset of the system (one service, mocked deps) that exercises the bug code path with a single function call.
7. **Property / fuzz loop.** If the bug is "sometimes wrong output", run 1000 random inputs and look for the failure mode.
8. **Bisection harness.** If the bug appeared between two known states (commit, dataset, version), automate "boot at state X, check, repeat" so you can `git bisect run` it.
9. **Differential loop.** Run the same input through old-version vs new-version (or two configs) and diff outputs.
10. **HITL bash script.** Last resort. If a human must click, drive _them_ with `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh` so the loop is still structured. Captured output feeds back to you.

Build the right feedback loop, and the bug is 90% fixed.

#### Tighten the loop

Treat the loop as a product. Once you have _a_ loop, **tighten** it:

- Can I make it faster? (Cache setup, skip unrelated init, narrow the test scope.)
- Can I make the signal sharper? (Assert on the specific symptom, not "didn't crash".)
- Can I make it more deterministic? (Pin time, seed RNG, isolate filesystem, freeze network.)

A 30-second flaky loop is barely better than no loop; a 2-second deterministic one is tight — a debugging superpower.

#### Non-deterministic bugs

The goal is not a clean repro but a **higher reproduction rate**. Loop the trigger 100×, parallelise, add stress, narrow timing windows, inject sleeps. A 50%-flake bug is debuggable; 1% is not — keep raising the rate until it's debuggable.

#### When you genuinely cannot build a loop

Stop and say so explicitly. List what you tried. Ask the user for: (a) access to whatever environment reproduces it, (b) a captured artifact (HAR file, log dump, core dump, screen recording with timestamps), or (c) permission to add temporary production instrumentation. Do **not** proceed to hypothesise without a loop.

#### Completion criterion — a tight loop that goes red

Phase 1 is done when the loop is **tight** and **red-capable**: you can name **one command** — a script path, a test invocation, a curl — that you have **already run at least once** (paste the invocation and its output), and that is:

- [ ] **Red-capable** — it drives the actual bug code path and asserts the **user's exact symptom**, so it can go red on this bug and green once fixed. Not "runs without erroring" — it must be able to _catch this specific bug_.
- [ ] **Deterministic** — same verdict every run (flaky bugs: a pinned, high reproduction rate, per above).
- [ ] **Fast** — seconds, not minutes.
- [ ] **Agent-runnable** — you can run it unattended; a human in the loop only via `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh`.

If you catch yourself reading code to build a theory before this command exists, **stop — jumping straight to a hypothesis is the exact failure this skill prevents.** No red-capable command, no Phase 2.

### Phase 2 — Reproduce + minimise

Run the loop. Watch it go red — the bug appears.

Confirm:

- [ ] The loop produces the failure mode the **user** described — not a different failure that happens to be nearby. Wrong bug = wrong fix.
- [ ] The failure is reproducible across multiple runs (or, for non-deterministic bugs, reproducible at a high enough rate to debug against).
- [ ] You have captured the exact symptom (error message, wrong output, slow timing) so later phases can verify the fix actually addresses it.

#### Minimise

Once it's red, shrink the repro to the **smallest scenario that still goes red**. Cut inputs, callers, config, data, and steps **one at a time**, re-running the loop after each cut — keep only what's load-bearing for the failure.

Why bother: a minimal repro shrinks the hypothesis space in Phase 3 (fewer moving parts left to suspect) and becomes the clean regression test in Phase 5.

Done when **every remaining element is load-bearing** — removing any one of them makes the loop go green.

Do not proceed until you have reproduced **and** minimised.

### Phase 3 — Hypothesise

Generate **3–5 ranked hypotheses** before testing any of them. Single-hypothesis generation anchors on the first plausible idea.

Each hypothesis must be **falsifiable**: state the prediction it makes.

> Format: "If <X> is the cause, then <changing Y> will make the bug disappear / <changing Z> will make it worse."

If you cannot state the prediction, the hypothesis is a vibe — discard or sharpen it.

**Show the ranked list to the user before testing.** They often have domain knowledge that re-ranks instantly ("we just deployed a change to #3"), or know hypotheses they've already ruled out. Cheap checkpoint, big time saver. Don't block on it — proceed with your ranking if the user is AFK.

### Phase 4 — Instrument

Each probe must map to a specific prediction from Phase 3. **Change one variable at a time.**

Tool preference:

1. **Debugger / REPL inspection** if the env supports it. One breakpoint beats ten logs.
2. **Targeted logs** at the boundaries that distinguish hypotheses.
3. Never "log everything and grep".

**Tag every debug log** with a unique prefix, e.g. `[DEBUG-a4f2]`. Cleanup at the end becomes a single grep. Untagged logs survive; tagged logs die.

**Perf branch.** For performance regressions, logs are usually wrong. Instead: establish a baseline measurement (timing harness, `performance.now()`, profiler, query plan), then bisect. Measure first, fix second.

### Phase 5 — Fix + regression test

Write the regression test **before the fix** — but only if there is a **correct seam** for it.

A correct seam is one where the test exercises the **real bug pattern** as it occurs at the call site. If the only available seam is too shallow (single-caller test when the bug needs multiple callers, unit test that can't replicate the chain that triggered the bug), a regression test there gives false confidence.

**If no correct seam exists, that itself is the finding.** Note it. The codebase architecture is preventing the bug from being locked down. Flag this for the next phase.

If a correct seam exists:

1. Turn the minimised repro into a failing test at that seam.
2. Watch it fail.
3. Apply the fix.
4. Watch it pass.
5. Re-run the Phase 1 feedback loop against the original (un-minimised) scenario.

### Phase 6 — Cleanup + post-mortem

Required before declaring done:

- [ ] Original repro no longer reproduces (re-run the Phase 1 loop)
- [ ] Regression test passes (or absence of seam is documented)
- [ ] All `[DEBUG-...]` instrumentation removed (`grep` the prefix)
- [ ] Throwaway prototypes deleted (or moved to a clearly-marked debug location)
- [ ] The hypothesis that turned out correct is stated in the commit / PR message — so the next debugger learns

**Then ask: what would have prevented this bug?** If the answer involves architectural change (no good test seam, tangled callers, hidden coupling) hand off to the `/improve-codebase-architecture` skill with the specifics. Make the recommendation **after** the fix is in, not before — you have more information now than when you started.


### Limitations

- Requires the upstream tool, account, API key, or local setup when the workflow names one.
- Does not authorize destructive, production, paid, or external-message actions without explicit user approval.
- Validate generated artifacts or recommendations against the user's real sources before treating them as final.

## performance-optimizer

> **Descrição original:** Identifies and fixes performance bottlenecks in code, databases, and APIs. Measures before and after to prove improvements.
>
> **Fonte:** `community`

Find and fix performance bottlenecks. Measure, optimize, verify. Make it fast.

### When to Use This Skill

- App is slow or laggy
- User complains about performance
- Page load times are high
- API responses are slow
- Database queries take too long
- User mentions "slow", "lag", "performance", or "optimize"

### The Optimization Process

#### 1. Measure First

Never optimize without measuring:

```javascript
// Measure execution time
console.time('operation');
await slowOperation();
console.timeEnd('operation'); // operation: 2341ms
```

**What to measure:**
- Page load time
- API response time
- Database query time
- Function execution time
- Memory usage
- Network requests

#### 2. Find the Bottleneck

Use profiling tools to find the slow parts:

**Browser:**
```
DevTools → Performance tab → Record → Stop
Look for long tasks (red bars)
```

**Node.js:**
```bash
node --prof app.js
node --prof-process isolate-*.log > profile.txt
```

**Database:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

#### 3. Optimize

Fix the slowest thing first (biggest impact).

### Common Optimizations

#### Database Queries

**Problem: N+1 Queries**
```javascript
// Bad: N+1 queries
const users = await db.users.find();
for (const user of users) {
  user.posts = await db.posts.find({ userId: user.id }); // N queries
}

// Good: Single query with JOIN
const users = await db.users.find()
  .populate('posts'); // 1 query
```

**Problem: Missing Index**
```sql
-- Check slow query
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
-- Shows: Seq Scan (bad)

-- Add index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Check again
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
-- Shows: Index Scan (good)
```

**Problem: SELECT ***
```javascript
// Bad: Fetches all columns
const users = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users');

// Good: Only needed columns
const users = await db.query('SELECT id, name, email FROM users');
```

**Problem: No Pagination**
```javascript
// Bad: Returns all records
const users = await db.users.find();

// Good: Paginated
const users = await db.users.find()
  .limit(20)
  .skip((page - 1) * 20);
```

#### API Performance

**Problem: No Caching**
```javascript
// Bad: Hits database every time
app.get('/api/stats', async (req, res) => {
  const stats = await db.stats.calculate(); // Slow
  res.json(stats);
});

// Good: Cache for 5 minutes
const cache = new Map();
app.get('/api/stats', async (req, res) => {
  const cached = cache.get('stats');
  if (cached && Date.now() - cached.time < 300000) {
    return res.json(cached.data);
  }
  
  const stats = await db.stats.calculate();
  cache.set('stats', { data: stats, time: Date.now() });
  res.json(stats);
});
```

**Problem: Sequential Operations**
```javascript
// Bad: Sequential (slow)
const user = await getUser(id);
const posts = await getPosts(id);
const comments = await getComments(id);
// Total: 300ms + 200ms + 150ms = 650ms

// Good: Parallel (fast)
const [user, posts, comments] = await Promise.all([
  getUser(id),
  getPosts(id),
  getComments(id)
]);
// Total: max(300ms, 200ms, 150ms) = 300ms
```

**Problem: Large Payloads**
```javascript
// Bad: Returns everything
res.json(users); // 5MB response

// Good: Only needed fields
res.json(users.map(u => ({
  id: u.id,
  name: u.name,
  email: u.email
}))); // 500KB response
```

#### Frontend Performance

**Problem: Unnecessary Re-renders**
```javascript
// Bad: Re-renders on every parent update
function UserList({ users }) {
  return users.map(user => <UserCard user={user} />);
}

// Good: Memoized
const UserCard = React.memo(({ user }) => {
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
});
```

**Problem: Large Bundle**
```javascript
// Bad: Imports entire library
import _ from 'lodash'; // 70KB

// Good: Import only what you need
import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'; // 2KB
```

**Problem: No Code Splitting**
```javascript
// Bad: Everything in one bundle
import HeavyComponent from './HeavyComponent';

// Good: Lazy load
const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));
```

**Problem: Unoptimized Images**
```html
<!-- Bad: Large image -->
<img src="photo.jpg" /> <!-- 5MB -->

<!-- Good: Optimized and responsive -->
<img 
  src="photo-small.webp" 
  srcset="photo-small.webp 400w, photo-large.webp 800w"
  loading="lazy"
  width="400"
  height="300"
/> <!-- 50KB -->
```

#### Algorithm Optimization

**Problem: Inefficient Algorithm**
```javascript
// Bad: O(n²) - nested loops
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const duplicates = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] === arr[j]) duplicates.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
}

// Good: O(n) - single pass with Set
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const duplicates = new Set();
  for (const item of arr) {
    if (seen.has(item)) duplicates.add(item);
    seen.add(item);
  }
  return Array.from(duplicates);
}
```

**Problem: Repeated Calculations**
```javascript
// Bad: Calculates every time
function getTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}
// Called 100 times in render

// Good: Memoized
const getTotal = useMemo(() => {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}, [items]);
```

#### Memory Optimization

**Problem: Memory Leak**
```javascript
// Bad: Event listener not cleaned up
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  // Memory leak!
}, []);

// Good: Cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
}, []);
```

**Problem: Large Data in Memory**
```javascript
// Bad: Loads entire file into memory
const data = fs.readFileSync('huge-file.txt'); // 1GB

// Good: Stream it
const stream = fs.createReadStream('huge-file.txt');
stream.on('data', chunk => process(chunk));
```

### Measuring Impact

Always measure before and after:

```javascript
// Before optimization
console.time('query');
const users = await db.users.find();
console.timeEnd('query');
// query: 2341ms

// After optimization (added index)
console.time('query');
const users = await db.users.find();
console.timeEnd('query');
// query: 23ms

// Improvement: 100x faster!
```

### Performance Budgets

Set targets:

```
Page Load: < 2 seconds
API Response: < 200ms
Database Query: < 50ms
Bundle Size: < 200KB
Time to Interactive: < 3 seconds
```

### Tools

**Browser:**
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Lighthouse (audit)
- Network tab (waterfall)

**Node.js:**
- `node --prof` (profiling)
- `clinic` (diagnostics)
- `autocannon` (load testing)

**Database:**
- `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (query plans)
- Slow query log
- Database profiler

**Monitoring:**
- New Relic
- Datadog
- Sentry Performance

### Quick Wins

Easy optimizations with big impact:

1. **Add database indexes** on frequently queried columns
2. **Enable gzip compression** on server
3. **Add caching** for expensive operations
4. **Lazy load** images and heavy components
5. **Use CDN** for static assets
6. **Minify and compress** JavaScript/CSS
7. **Remove unused dependencies**
8. **Use pagination** instead of loading all data
9. **Optimize images** (WebP, proper sizing)
10. **Enable HTTP/2** on server

### Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Measured current performance
- [ ] Identified bottleneck
- [ ] Applied optimization
- [ ] Measured improvement
- [ ] Verified functionality still works
- [ ] No new bugs introduced
- [ ] Documented the change

### When NOT to Optimize

- Premature optimization (optimize when it's actually slow)
- Micro-optimizations (save 1ms when page takes 5 seconds)
- Readable code is more important than tiny speed gains
- If it's already fast enough

### Key Principles

- Measure before optimizing
- Fix the biggest bottleneck first
- Measure after to prove improvement
- Don't sacrifice readability for tiny gains
- Profile in production-like environment
- Consider the 80/20 rule (20% of code causes 80% of slowness)

### Related Skills

- `@bug-hunter` - Debugging

### Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.

## tdd

> **Descrição original:** Test-driven development. Use when the user wants to build features or fix bugs test-first, mentions "red-green-refactor", or wants integration tests.
>
> **Fonte:** `mattpocock/skills`  
> **Autor:** Matt Pocock

### When to Use

Use when this workflow matches the user request: Use this skill for its documented workflow.


_Source: [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT)._

### Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it. A good test reads like a specification - "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the interface). The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed. If you rename an internal function and tests fail, those tests were testing implementation, not behavior.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

### Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" - treating RED as "write all tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces **crap tests**:

- Tests written in bulk test _imagined_ behavior, not _actual_ behavior
- You end up testing the _shape_ of things (data structures, function signatures) rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes - they pass when behavior breaks, fail when behavior is fine
- You outrun your headlights, committing to test structure before understanding the implementation

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test → one implementation → repeat. Each test responds to what you learned from the previous cycle. Because you just wrote the code, you know exactly what behavior matters and how to verify it.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED→GREEN: test1→impl1
  RED→GREEN: test2→impl2
  RED→GREEN: test3→impl3
  ...
```

### Workflow

#### 1. Planning

When exploring the codebase, read `CONTEXT.md` (if it exists) so that test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Before writing any code:

- [ ] Confirm with user what interface changes are needed
- [ ] Confirm with user which behaviors to test (prioritize)
- [ ] Identify opportunities for deep modules (small interface, deep implementation) — run the `/codebase-design` skill for the vocabulary and the testability checks
- [ ] List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps)
- [ ] Get user approval on the plan

Ask: "What should the public interface look like? Which behaviors are most important to test?"

**You can't test everything.** Confirm with the user exactly which behaviors matter most. Focus testing effort on critical paths and complex logic, not every possible edge case.

#### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system:

```
RED:   Write test for first behavior → test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass → test passes
```

This is your tracer bullet - proves the path works end-to-end.

#### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
RED:   Write next test → fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass → passes
```

Rules:

- One test at a time
- Only enough code to pass current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

#### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass, look for [refactor candidates](refactoring.md):

- [ ] Extract duplication
- [ ] Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles where natural
- [ ] Consider what new code reveals about existing code
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

### Checklist Per Cycle

```
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive internal refactor
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
```


### Limitations

- Requires the upstream tool, account, API key, or local setup when the workflow names one.
- Does not authorize destructive, production, paid, or external-message actions without explicit user approval.
- Validate generated artifacts or recommendations against the user's real sources before treating them as final.

### When to Use

Use when this workflow matches the user request: Move issues and external PRs through a state machine of triage roles — categorise, verify, grill if needed, and write agent-ready briefs.


_Source: [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT)._

Move issues on the project issue tracker through a small state machine of triage roles.

If this repo treats external pull requests as a request surface (see the issue-tracker config), triage covers them too: **a PR is an issue with attached code** — same roles, same states, same machine, with a few deltas marked "for a PR" below. Resolve a bare `#42` to an issue or PR per the tracker config.

Every comment or issue posted to the issue tracker during triage **must** start with this disclaimer:

```
> *This was generated by AI during triage.*
```

### Reference docs

- [AGENT-BRIEF.md](AGENT-BRIEF.md) — how to write durable agent briefs
- [OUT-OF-SCOPE.md](OUT-OF-SCOPE.md) — how the `.out-of-scope/` knowledge base works

### Roles

Two **category** roles:

- `bug` — something is broken
- `enhancement` — new feature or improvement

Five **state** roles:

- `needs-triage` — maintainer needs to evaluate
- `needs-info` — waiting on reporter for more information
- `ready-for-agent` — fully specified, ready for an AFK agent
- `ready-for-human` — needs human implementation
- `wontfix` — will not be actioned

For a PR, the same states read against the attached code: `ready-for-agent` means a brief is attached and an agent should take the next step on the diff; `ready-for-human` means it's ready for a human to merge.

Every triaged issue should carry exactly one category role and one state role. If state roles conflict, flag it and ask the maintainer before doing anything else.

These are canonical role names — the actual label strings used in the issue tracker may differ. The mapping should have been provided to you - run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` if not.

State transitions: an unlabeled issue normally goes to `needs-triage` first; from there it moves to `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, or `wontfix`. `needs-info` returns to `needs-triage` once the reporter replies. The maintainer can override at any time — flag transitions that look unusual and ask before proceeding.

### Invocation

The maintainer invokes `/triage` and describes what they want in natural language. Interpret the request and act. Examples:

- "Show me anything that needs my attention"
- "Let's look at #42" (issue or PR)
- "Move #42 to ready-for-agent"
- "What's ready for agents to pick up?"

### Show what needs attention

Query the issue tracker and present three buckets, oldest first:

1. **Unlabeled** — never triaged.
2. **`needs-triage`** — evaluation in progress.
3. **`needs-info` with reporter activity since the last triage notes** — needs re-evaluation.

When PRs are in scope, include external PRs in these buckets and tag each line `[PR]` or `[issue]`. Discovery surfaces only *external* PRs (the tracker config defines who counts as external) — a collaborator's in-flight PR is not triage work. This filter is discovery-only; an explicitly named PR is always triaged regardless of author.

Show counts and a one-line summary per item. Let the maintainer pick.

### Triage a specific issue or PR

1. **Gather context.** Read the full issue or PR (body, comments, labels, author, dates; for a PR, the diff too). Parse any prior triage notes so you don't re-ask resolved questions. Explore the codebase using the project's domain glossary, respecting ADRs in the area. Run two checks against the codebase: (a) **redundancy** — search for an existing implementation of the requested behavior by domain concept (not just the request's wording), and report where you looked. If found, it's an already-implemented `wontfix` (step 5). (b) **prior rejection** — read `.out-of-scope/*.md` and surface any that resembles this request.

2. **Recommend.** Tell the maintainer your category and state recommendation with reasoning, plus a brief codebase summary relevant to the request — including whether it's already implemented. Wait for direction.

3. **Verify the claim.** Before any grilling, check that the claim holds up. For a bug, reproduce it from the reporter's steps. For a PR, confirm the diff does what it claims — check it out, run the relevant tests or commands. Report what happened: confirmed (with code path), failed, or insufficient detail (a strong `needs-info` signal). A confirmed verification makes a much stronger agent brief.

4. **Grill (if needed).** If the request needs fleshing out, run the `/grilling` and `/domain-modeling` skills together — grill it into shape one question at a time, sharpening domain terms and updating `CONTEXT.md`/ADRs inline as decisions land.

5. **Apply the outcome:**
   - `ready-for-agent` — post an agent brief comment ([AGENT-BRIEF.md](AGENT-BRIEF.md)).
   - `ready-for-human` — same structure as an agent brief, but note why it can't be delegated (judgment calls, external access, design decisions, manual testing).
   - `needs-info` — post triage notes (template below).
   - `wontfix` — close, with the comment depending on *why*:
     - **Already implemented** — the change already exists in the codebase. Point to where it lives; do **not** write to `.out-of-scope/` (that KB is for *rejected* requests, not built ones).
     - **Rejected (bug)** — polite explanation, then close.
     - **Rejected (enhancement)** — write to `.out-of-scope/`, link to it from a comment, then close ([OUT-OF-SCOPE.md](OUT-OF-SCOPE.md)).
   - `needs-triage` — apply the role. Optional comment if there's partial progress.

### Quick state override

If the maintainer says "move #42 to ready-for-agent", trust them and apply the role directly. Confirm what you're about to do (role changes, comment, close), then act. Skip grilling. If moving to `ready-for-agent` without a grilling session, ask whether they want to write an agent brief.

### Needs-info template

```markdown
## Triage Notes

**What we've established so far:**

- point 1
- point 2

**What we still need from you (@reporter):**

- question 1
- question 2
```

Capture everything resolved during grilling under "established so far" so the work isn't lost. Questions must be specific and actionable, not "please provide more info".

### Resuming a previous session

If prior triage notes exist on the issue or PR, read them, check whether the reporter has answered any outstanding questions, and present an updated picture before continuing. Don't re-ask resolved questions.


### Limitations

- Requires the upstream tool, account, API key, or local setup when the workflow names one.
- Does not authorize destructive, production, paid, or external-message actions without explicit user approval.
- Validate generated artifacts or recommendations against the user's real sources before treating them as final.
